# DayPlanner

Homework 5

Using Bootstrap, Moment, and jQuery I was able to create a day planner. With this app you are able to schedule your day out in timeblocks starting at 9AM - 5PM in hour increments. By using the text box you are able to type out your event and click the save button that will store your event in the local storage and save it. If you refresh the page it will still be saved on there.
